# Hydroscan
The HYDROSCAN project is an unmanned surface vehicle monitoring water quality using sensors for temperature, pH, TDS, and turbidity. A single-board computer processes data and uses LoRaWAN for remote monitoring. Supported by HAVELSAN and TÜBİTAK, it operates semi-autonomously with plans for full autonomy and machine learning.
