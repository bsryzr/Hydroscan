# HYDROSCAN - Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for Water Quality Monitoring
# Project Overview 
The HYDROSCAN project aims to design and implement an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to monitor water quality in various aquatic environments. It leverages advanced sensor technology and automation to provide real-time water quality data, making the monitoring process more efficient and accurate.
# Key Features:
Sensors: Temperature, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Turbidity
Remote Monitoring: Uses LoRaWAN for long-range communication
Energy Efficiency: Solar-powered with low-energy components
Autonomous Navigation: GPS-enabled for route planning and navigation
# System Components
Microcontroller: STM32F407 Discovery board
Communication Module: LoRa Grove Wio E5
Navigation: GPS integrated for location tracking
Energy Source: Solar panels and rechargeable batteries
Sensors:
pH Sensor
Temperature Sensor
Turbidity Sensor
TDS Sensor
# Working Principle
The HYDROSCAN USV operates autonomously, moving to pre-programmed GPS coordinates, collecting water quality data, and returning to its starting point. Data is transmitted in real-time to a base station using LoRaWAN, ensuring continuous monitoring and analysis.

# Design and Implementation
Mechanical Design: Developed in SOLIDWORKS
Mathematical Modelling: Simulated using MATLAB/Simulink
Controller Design: Linearization and trimming techniques for accuracy
# Sponsors & Support
HAVELSAN: Mentorship and guidance
TÜBİTAK: Applied for 2209-A Research Projects Support
İMTES: Chassis production sponsorship
How to Use
Deploy the HYDROSCAN vehicle in the desired water body.
Monitor real-time data via the user interface.
Analyze water quality data remotely through the LoRaWAN network.
