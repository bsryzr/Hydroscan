# Hydroscan
The HYDROSCAN project is an unmanned surface vehicle monitoring water quality using sensors for temperature, pH, TDS, and turbidity. A single-board computer processes data and uses LoRaWAN for remote monitoring. Supported by HAVELSAN and TÜBİTAK, it operates semi-autonomously with plans for full autonomy and machine learning.
The HYDROSCAN project addresses a multifaceted problem inherent in current water quality monitoring practices, which are pivotal for environmental health and public safety. Traditional methods of assessing water quality typically involve laborious and time-consuming processes, such as the collection of samples and subsequent laboratory analysis. This approach often leads to significant delays between data collection and actionable insights, hindering prompt responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Moreover, many water bodies are located in remote or hazardous areas, making consistent and safe monitoring a challenging endeavor. The complexity of accurately measuring water quality is compounded by the variety of influencing factors, ranging from chemical and physical properties to biological components. These challenges are further exacerbated by the ongoing impacts of climate change, which is altering global water cycles and leading to more extreme weather events like floods and droughts, significantly affecting water quality. The need for sustainable water resource management, under these changing environmental conditions, underscores the necessity of a
